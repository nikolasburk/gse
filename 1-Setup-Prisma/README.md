# Set up Prisma

You can get started with Prisma either using a _Demo server_ hosted in [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud/) or with your own local Prisma server (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com)). We recommend using a Demo server if you're just getting started and want to explore Prisma's capabilities.

## Use Prisma Demo server (beginner's choice)

- [Try out Prisma in 30 seconds](01-Try-out-Prisma-in-30-seconds.md)

## Local setup (requires Docker)

- [Create new database](02-Create-new-Database.md)
- Use existing database (_coming soon_)
