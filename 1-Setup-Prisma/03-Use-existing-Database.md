# Use existing Database

## Step 1: Install the Prisma CLI on your machine

```bash
npm install -g prisma
```

## Step 2: Install Docker on your machine

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

## Step 3: Setup database and Prisma server

### 3.1: Create the Docker Compose file

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### 3.2: Add Prisma and database Docker images

Paste the following contents into `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.11
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: __DB_CONNECTOR__
            host: __YOUR_DB_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_DB_PORT__
            user: __YOUR_DB_USERNAME__
            password: __YOUR_DB_PASSWORD__
            migrations: true
```

Replace the following placeholders in the above `docker-compose.yml`:

- `__DB_CONNECTOR__`: Select the database connector you want to use: `mysql` or `postgres`
- `__YOUR_DB_HOST__`: Set the database host (IP address or domain of the server where the database is running)
- `__YOUR_DB_PORT__`: Set the port on which the database is running
- `__YOUR_DB_USERNAME__` & `__YOUR_DB_PASSWORD__`: Set the database credentials (user and password)

<Details>
  <Summary>See `docker-compose.yml` for Postgres</Summary>

Here is what the `docker-compose.yml` looks like for Postgres:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.11
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: __DB_CONNECTOR__
            host: __YOUR_DB_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_DB_PORT__
            user: __YOUR_DB_USERNAME__
            password: __YOUR_DB_PASSWORD__
            migrations: true
```

</Details>

### 3.3: Start Prisma server and database

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your Prisma _server_ is now running on `http://localhost:4466`, so you can deploy Prisma _services_ to it.

## Step 4: Create your Prisma service configuration

```bash
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
prisma init
```

## Step 5: Generate your data model

Prisma introspects the schema of your database and generates a data model in GraphQL SDL from it:

```bash
prisma introspect
```

When the CLI prompts you where to store the generated data model, choose to override the current `datamodel.graphql` that was generated by `prisma init`.

## Step 6: Deploy your Prisma service

```bash
prisma deploy
```

## Step 7: Open a GraphQL Playground

```bash
prisma playground
```

## Step 7: Explore the service's CRUD GraphQL API

**Create a new `User`**:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Alice"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

> Copy the `id` of the `createUser` object returned in the Playground and use it for the `__USER_ID__` placeholer value in the following `updateUser`- and `deleteUser`-mutations.

**Query all `User`s**:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Update a `User`'s `name`**:

```graphql
query {
  updateUser(
    where: { id: "__USER_ID__" },
    data: { name: "Sarah" }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Delete a `User`**:

```graphql
query {
  deleteUser(where: {
    id: "__USER_ID__"
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
